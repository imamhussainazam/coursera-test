	<p>Let me start by introducing myself. My name is Imam and I belong to a village in Siwan district of Bihar, Husena. Although it's not a popular place but you may have heard it's name in the news regarding some notorious gangs, to start with.But don't worry. I have grown up in Darjeeling,W.B and rarely used to visit my village. And now I study in IIT Patna.</p>
<p>Right from my childhood I have been curious of learning new skills, of doing new activities and seeking knowledge. It is my this nature which has helped me to develop various skills and interests and is even helping me currently. My interests include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Photography</li>
	<li>Writing</li>
	<li>Poetry</li>
	<li>Video Editing</li>
	<li>Athletics</li>
	<li>Coding</li>
</ul>

<article>
	<p>Revolution seeks those who are dauntless</p>
	<p>Who in their logics are clear and bright</p>
	<p>With flames of reasoning not giving up on lies</p>
	<p>Of the slanderers, of those fed with a ransom diet</p>
	<p>Who follow not the worldly temptation</p>
	<p>Never leaving aside their great insight</p>
	<p>Such that others are safe and alright</p>
	<p>So write for the cause which is right</p>
	<p>The above portion is taken from my poem while(cause!=0)write;</p>
